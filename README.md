An up-and-coming pair of acupuncturists in the Portland area were looking for a way to migrate their patient data collection to a digital solution from their current paper-and-pencil system. They wanted an application to use on their iPads, and I determined that a PhoneGap/Cordova application written in XCode on the Mac would be the most direct implementation for their needs.

The application is based around HTML5 and CSS3 and uses a custom SQLite plugin to store consultation data locally. When the program starts up, the practitioner has the option of entering a new patient into the system or using an existing patient. Once the patient is selected, the patient is put through a series of diagnostic tests to determine range of motion and associated pain. After measurements are taken, the application is able to determine the highest priority energy meridians for the acupuncturist to begin unblocking. This information can also be exported to a file and provided to the patient. A couple of screen captures are shown below.
